实现特征

Among content-aware features, we extract features based on term frequency, including DPH [9], PL2 [9], and BM25 [9]; language modeling, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) [9], Query Likelihood with Jelinek-Mercer (QLM-JM ) [9], Query Likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing (QLM-DS) [9], and Term-dependency Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) [9]; lexical, including edit distance, sub-string match (SSM ) [5], term overlap [5], and term synonym overlap (TSO) [5]; web hit-count, including normalized hit count (NHC), point-wise mutual information (PMI ), and word co-occurrence (WC); and some query independent features, including aver- age term length (ATL), topic cohesiveness (TC) [9], and subtopic length (SL).
